# VSCode Extensions üìÇ

This repository contains a script to install Visual Studio Code extensions listed in the `extensions.txt` file. The script checks for already installed extensions and installs only the missing ones, improving performance and efficiency.

### ‚ú® Key Features of the Setup Script:
- Ensures `extensions.txt` exists before proceeding.
- Stores already installed extensions in a variable for quick lookup.
- Skips reinstallation of extensions unless needed.
- Uses the `--force` flag to install or update extensions to the latest version.
- Installs multiple extensions simultaneously using `xargs`, improving speed.
- Provides real-time status updates on the installation process.
- Reports if an extension fails to install.
