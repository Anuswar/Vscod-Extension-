# VSCode Extensions üìÇ

Welcome to the VSCode Extensions repository! This project simplifies the installation of essential Visual Studio Code extensions used by me. With a single script, you can quickly set up your coding environment across various operating systems, ensuring all necessary extensions are installed and up-to-date.

### ‚ú® Key Features of the Setup Script:
- **File Check**: Ensures `extensions.txt` exists before proceeding.
- **Extensions Cache**: Stores already installed extensions for quick lookup.
- **Efficient Installation**: Skips reinstalling extensions unless necessary.
- **Forced Updates**: Uses the `--force` flag to install or update extensions to the latest version.
- **Parallel Processing**: Installs multiple extensions simultaneously using `xargs`.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Provides status updates during the installation process.
- **Error Reporting**: Alerts you if an extension fails to install.
